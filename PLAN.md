# ColdPath: Secure USB Protocol for Cold Wallets

## Vision
ColdPath is a protocol for securely transferring Bitcoin transactions between air-gapped wallets and full nodes using USB drives. It prioritizes privacy, security, and interoperability with Bitcoin Core, with a long-term vision of becoming a standard for secure offline transaction handling in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## MVP Objectives
- Secure transfer of Bitcoin transactions (PSBT) via USB drives.
- Cryptographic hash validation for file integrity.
- Integration with Bitcoin Core using its RPC interface.
- Adherence to Bitcoin's existing standards (e.g., PSBT, BIP-174) to ensure compatibility and ease of adoption.

## Development Steps
1. Design the file structure for transaction data.
   - Use the PSBT format (BIP-174) for transaction representation.
   - Define a structure for hash validation files.
2. Implement file transfer validation using SHA-256.
   - Ensure hash validation is simple, deterministic, and reproducible.
3. Test air-gapped compatibility.
   - Simulate usage scenarios across different operating systems and devices.
4. Document setup and usage instructions.
   - Provide clear guides for integrating ColdPath with Bitcoin Core and other compatible tools.

## Long-Term Vision
- Develop ColdPath as a widely accepted tool or standard for secure offline transaction handling.
- Engage with the Bitcoin developer community to propose ColdPath as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).
- Explore potential integration or interoperability with Bitcoin Core to streamline its usage for node operators.

## Future Features
- Multi-signature transaction support.
- USB encryption for sensitive data.
- Enhanced error handling and user-friendly notifications.
- Compatibility with hardware wallets and other Bitcoin wallets.
